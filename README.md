# eulers-lisp
Lisp Solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

# Setup

If you're on a Mac, install the following with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```
brew install sbcl
brew install homebrew/boneyard/gambit-scheme
```

This installs Steel Bank Common Lisp and Gambit (a scheme interpreter/compiler). The latter needs GCC installed (`brew install gcc`).
